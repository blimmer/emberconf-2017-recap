```

```notes
many people are using LTS versions, though lots keep up to date with the most current, likely because of glimmer 2.
```

## "How can we improve Ember?"

> Performance was a common theme regardless of experience with Ember. Documentation and guide improvement requests were more common from developers with less Ember experience while requests for tree shaking, routable components and mobile support were more prevalent among experienced Ember developers.
